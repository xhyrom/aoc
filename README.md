### ðŸŒŸ What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event featuring 25 programming
puzzles, one for each day from December 1st to December 25th. These puzzles can be solved in
any programming language, offering a fun and engaging way to test your skills and learn new
concepts during the holiday season.
